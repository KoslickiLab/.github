## Welcome to the Koslicki lab ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹
The Koslicki lab focuses on computational biology. We are interested in developing efficient, mathematically sound approaches to extract insight from omics data. This puts our research squarely at the intersection of biology, mathematics, and computer science. We are particularly interested in the entire arc of developing computational biology methods: rigorous mathematical justification of a method, implementing the method into a tool usable by the community, applying the tool to pressing scientific problems, and finally using the results to inform further development of computational techniques.
