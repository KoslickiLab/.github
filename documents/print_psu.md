## Print Posters at PSU

Use the PSU print service for posters. They do fabric, are quite quick and quality is good.


Please feel free to edit this document after having done a print job : )

### How

---

[PSU print portal](https://www.psuprints.psu.edu/): login with your PSU account and follow instructions. I'm not clear which payment method should we specify now (you may ask Dr. Koslicki before putting print orders). More information about PSU print:

1. Go to PSU [Multimedia & Print Center](https://multimediaprint.psu.edu/)
2. Click the `PSU Prints` tab on top of the webpage: it will guide you to the print portal (use PSU account to login)

### Instructions

You may also call (814) 865-7544 if you are having any trouble entering your poster.



Once in the portal, you can use your PSU email and PSU password that you use for logging into all other PSU applications. 

1. Select, Wide Format Print,

2. Select the pdf file of your poster (pdf files work best)

3. Preview the file and then check the box indicating that you have viewed the proof

(note: even if the proof is blurry, or black and white, your poster will be clear so long as your pdf file is clear) 

At this point you should see this: 

[Enter special instructions for this item.]()



4. Click on the special instructions line and enter the size of the poster, and the type of paper you would like it printed on. Here is an example:

```
Please print Size ## x ## inches (use the size you want your poster to be, for example, a common size is 36 x 48 inches)
On regular poster paper
In Color (or, you may request black and white, if you prefer that)
Please, Hold for Pick Up
```

   Under Shipping Method choose the drop down option **Hold for Pickup.**

6. In the pink box under shipping information, click on the pencil icon, update the campus address information. Be sure to include a College/Department in the box under the email box.
7. In the green box under billing information, click on the pencil icon and add your information.
8. For **payment method**, an internal order number, or cost code may be used and entered. If you are paying for this poster using a credit card when you pick it up, please select the credit card option. If the credit card option is used, the field for **CC or WBS or IO Number** needs to be filled in with zeros. It may take 10 or 12 zeros to fill the field completely. (ie. 0000000000)
9. Finally, click **Place Order.** If you receive an error message and cannot determine why, please call us at (814) 865-7544
10. You will receive an email stating that your order has been submitted. This will include your order number.



When your poster is printed, you will receive an email notifying you that your poster is ready to be picked up.
